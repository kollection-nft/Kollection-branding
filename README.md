### **Font**

Kollection logo font is Montserrat

The old posters and signs in the traditional *Montserrat* neighborhood
of Buenos Aires inspired Julieta Ulanovsky to design this typeface and
rescue the beauty of urban typography that emerged in the first half of
the twentieth century. As urban development changes that place, it will
never return to its original form and loses forever the designs that are
so special and unique. The letters that inspired this project have work,
dedication, care, color, contrast, light and life, day and night! These
are the types that make the city look so beautiful. The Montserrat
Project began with the idea to rescue what is in Montserrat and set it
free under a libre license, the SIL Open Font License.

This is the normal family, and it has two sister families so far,
[Alternates](http://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat+Alternates) and
[Subrayada](http://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat+Subrayada). Many
of the letterforms are special in the Alternates family, while
\'Subrayada\' means \'Underlined\' in Spanish and celebrates a special
style of underline that is integrated into the letterforms found in the
*Montserrat* neighborhood.

Updated November 2017: The family was redrawn by Jacques Le Bailly at
[Baron von Fonthausen](http://www.baronvonfonthausen.com/) over the
summer, and the full set of weights were adjusted to make the Regular
lighter and better for use in longer texts. In fall, Julieta Ulanovsky,
Sol Matas, and Juan Pablo del Peral, led the development of Cyrillic
support, with consultation with Carolina Giovagnoli, Maria Doreuli, and
Alexei Vanyashin.

Kollection body text font is Albert Sans

Albert Sans is a modern geometric sans serif family, inspired by the
type-characteristics of scandinavian architects and designers in the
early 20th century. The Albert Sans family includes ten weights from
Thin to Black and supports over two hundred languages.
